# Havoc Hub

A multi-game script suite for Roblox, built for the [Potassium](https://docs.potassium.pro/) executor. One loader picks the right script for the current game — and falls back to a universal toolkit anywhere else.

## How it works

`loader.luau` checks `game.PlaceId` when you execute it:

1. **`games/<PlaceId>.luau`** — if the repo has a script for the current game, that one loads (e.g. `games/7336302630.luau` is the Project Delta suite).
2. **`games/universal.luau`** — otherwise the universal script loads: generic aimbot, ESP and utilities that work across most games.

Adding support for a new game is just dropping a `<PlaceId>.luau` file into `games/` — no loader changes needed.

## Quick start (loader)

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Randeyeuhm/havoc-hub/main/loader.luau"))()
```

Everything runs through `loadstring` — the loader fetches the matching script plus the shared modules (`uilib.luau` and `esp.luau`) and loads them straight into memory. Nothing is copied into your executor's workspace; only your config files are written there — all inside a single `havoc_hub/` folder.

### Structure dumper

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Randeyeuhm/havoc-hub/main/dumper-loader.luau"))()
```

Run it in any game to fetch and execute the latest `StructureDumper.Luau` in one paste — the dump lands in your executor's workspace as `havoc_structure.txt`.

## Games

### Project Delta — `games/7336302630.luau` (PlaceId 7336302630)

The original suite:

- **Aimbot** — target selection, FOV control, visible-only check, silent aim, ballistics tuning
- **ESP** — Player / NPC / Drops / Radar. Names, health, distance, team colors; vehicles (e.g. MI-24V) included; optional landmine overlay
- **Inventory ESP**, HUD, radar, movement/misc tweaks, persistent config and rebindable hotkeys

### Driving Empire — `games/3351674303.luau` (PlaceId 3351674303)

Built against the game's decompiled source — vehicle physics run client-side:

- **Vehicle** — speed, acceleration, grip, steering and brake multipliers (engine, torque, tyre traction, turn-in and braking in the client physics), instant gearshifts (the shift finishes the frame it starts — no clutch/throttle cut), chassis-lock bypass (the game's client-side guard freezes the car and its wheels once you pass 3.5× its stock top speed — the script keeps that tripwire above your actual speed), infinite nitro, ignore speed caps — plus a remove-tires glitch toggle (hides + un-collides your wheels)
- **Teleports** — Race Hub, main dealership, aviation + boat garages, drag strip, bank, police station, drawbridge
- **HUD** — live speedometer (MPH, gear, RPM) straight from the car's chassis controller, plus your cash
- **Money** — live cash readout on the HUD
- **Auto farm** — holds the throttle (optional steer bias for circles) so driving income keeps ticking while you're AFK; auto-reverses when stuck; **sky plate** mode builds a personal 10,000-stud-high plate and u-turns at its edges
- **Race** — "Finish race" button: jumps your car through every checkpoint of the race you're in (in order — the game's own crossing detection reports each one) and crosses the finish line; works on any race you've joined
- **Visuals** — player ESP with the full customizer, fullbright
- **Misc** — anti-AFK, reset character, rejoin server

### Deadline — `games/12144402492.luau` (PlaceId 12144402492, GameId 4283416256)

Built against the game's decompiled source — weapon handling runs client-side and reads its tunables live every shot:

- **Recoil / Spread** — Recoil % (scales the game's global `plr_recoil` multiplier plus every recoil trait through its own debug-values table) and Spread % (`plr_barrel_deviation` / `plr_buck_barrel_deviation`) — 100% = vanilla, 0% = dead straight / zero kick
- **Speed** — Aim In Speed (`plr_viewmodel_state_transition_speed` — the gun raises, leans and crouches faster; capped at ×3 because the game's transition lerp overshoots past that and flails the viewmodel), Weapon Switch speed, Ergonomics multiplier (the stat behind lean / handling timings), Reload Speed (×1–×3 — feeds the live reload animation track extra time per frame so the whole reload pipeline runs faster: mag out, mag in, chambering, completion) — x1 = vanilla
- **Ballistics** — ~~Bullet Velocity~~ (**removed** — live testing showed the server's shot validation instantly bans client-side muzzle-velocity changes the moment they actually apply; the saved value is forced back to vanilla), Wallbang (×1–×100 — scales the game's live projectile penetration multiplier so rounds punch through walls), No Bullet Drop (forces the caster's shared gravity value to zero at bullet creation — the g·t² term in the projectile path disappears entirely, so bullets fly dead straight at any range, in-flight ones included; the wrappers are environment-masked around the game's anti-exploit getfenv tripwire and cap bullet flight distance while on to keep the sim cheap; client-local; **same shot-validation risk family as the removed velocity slider** — leave it off if you value the account) and **Zeroed Aim** (far-range hitreg done right: the server validates every shot against its own vanilla flight model, so x15 bullets or zero drop get far hits rejected — Zeroed Aim keeps the model 100% vanilla and pitches each shot up by exactly the drop at the aimed distance, so the round arcs onto the crosshair and the server's own simulation agrees at any range; forces ×1 bullet velocity and is mutually exclusive with No Bullet Drop)
- **Misc tab** — Zero Weight (walk at weightless speed — a live speed override cancels the game's carried-weight divisor exactly, so heavy kits move like a knife-only one), Infinite Stamina (sprint / lean / jump / vault drains → 0), Fullbright (adjustable ambient intensity — no shadows or fog, re-checked every frame so weather can't dim it again), No Deafness (removes the game's death & explosion hearing-loss and mutes the tinnitus ringing) and the global Restore — the Weapons tab now keeps only gun settings — plus a test-only "Trigger caster.fire trap" button that deliberately calls the caster's fire *unmasked* so the game's `getenv` honeypot trips (taunt + busy-loop until rejoin; double-click confirm)
- **Aimbot / ESP** — head-locking camera aimbot (FOV radius, smoothing, visible check, Hold-RMB / Always, FOV circle), **Silent Aim** (each shot is redirected at the nearest enemy within a configurable FOV angle the instant it fires — local sim and the server's shot record both get the redirected direction, your camera never moves; on-screen FOV circle draws the exact cone, visible-only option, drop + wind compensated, one-step lead for moving targets; the module hides itself from the live client, so it is found through three paths — dump path, descendant search, then a getgc walk — and auto-arms as soon as the match replicates it; the FOV ring is grey until the module hooks and orange once armed, and telemetry stays quiet while shots redirect (it only prints when a stage dies, and never costs a heap walk in healthy play) and full player ESP (box, name, distance, chams, tracers) built around the game's custom rigs — characters are UserId-named models in `Workspace.characters` and names resolve through hidden-character-tolerant UserId matching plus a per-player scan (username / display name / UserId); the aimbot's visibility check now ignores the game's own `workspace.ignore` folder (viewmodels and effects live there — they used to block every ray, silently killing the aimbot) and the aim lock binds in the last render slot so the game's late camera updates can't overwrite it — names resolve through the game's own replication records via a cached session-id index (the numeric rig names finally map to real players, and the records carry the username), targeting is measured from the crosshair centre, and on executors with `mousemoverel` the aim moves the mouse through the game's own input path (camera-lock fallback); the local sim rig ("StarterCharacter") is excluded from both ESP and aimbot
- **Stability** — Steady Aim (aiming and holding breath never drain arm stamina, breathing shake off) and Zero Sight Sway (no camera bob while walking, no gun lag when turning, no walk/run weapon weave, no breathing wobble, idle fidgets or noise drift — the sight stays glued; uses the game's offset limit plus its live springs, animation weights, breath, fidget and noise sources, and switches off the breath equalizer so the pinned breath value can't leave a constant muffle on the mix)
- Everything applies and restores live — no hooks, no remotes, nothing sent to the server; lowered values re-assert themselves
- The whole Deadline universe (lobby + match places) loads this one script via the loader's universe map

### Oaklands — `games/9938675423.luau` (PlaceId 9938675423, GameId 3666294218)

Built from the game's decompiled source — everything gameplay-side flows through the game's own buffer networking, so this one sticks to the safe levers:

- **Tree ESP** — every choppable tree (`World.TreeRegions` — the `Choppable` + `AltName` attributes the axe code itself reads) gets a species + distance label, optional highlight, and a species filter built live from the game's own `INFO` registry (keep the rares, hide the junk)
- **Rock ESP** — every minable rock (the game's own `World.RockRegions` — `Mineable`/`AltName` attributes the chisel code reads) plus loose rocks (meteorites) gets a type + distance label and optional highlight; ore-bearing rocks show what they carry straight from the `OreName` attribute (Copper, Iron, Gold, Mythril, Amethyst, Quartz, Sand...). Its rock-type filter list fills itself from the rocks you've actually seen and persists across sessions
- **Loose Item ESP** — everything under the game's own `Item` tag, with name + distance; items that carry the game's `Price` / `EggsPrice` attribute (store displays, merchant goods) show it in the label
- **Enemy ESP** and **Player ESP** — name + distance labels (players resolved from the username-named characters in the workspace)
- **~~Auto Chop~~ (removed in oak-v2)** — live testing showed it does not work and crashes the client; its swing channel (`Backpack:InformServer`) is server-validated with client self-reporting, so the script sends nothing anymore
- **~~Infinite Stamina~~ (removed in oak-v4)** — live testing got it detected and crashed the client
- **Enhanced Drag (optional, client-side)** — the carry mechanic is the dragger. The live game runs the *classic* dragger (`Client_Drag2025Enabled = false` — the newer `Drag` module never loads), so this feature finds **whichever dragger module is live** via `getgc` and tunes it client-side: reach (`MaxDragDistance`, vanilla 12 studs — the game range-checks every grab *and* the held distance against it) and pull strength (the module's reused `DragConstructors` — `AlignPosition.MaxForce` / `AlignOrientation.MaxTorque`, rewritten at each drag start from the `DragForce`/`DragTorque` attributes or 15000/48500; strength multiplies up to **100000x**, final force clamped at 1e12 — past ~100x Roblox's own velocity cap is the real ceiling). The console prints each multiplier the moment it lands on a live drag. Pure client physics of a drag the server already granted, zero packets, off by default — server checks on dragging are unknown, so creep the strength up and watch for rubber-banding; **Throw Power** (same 100000x cap, needs Enhanced Drag on) watches the G-throw and adds `(multiplier − 1) ×` the game's own impulse at the same spot/direction one frame after a real release; **No-Collide Drag** toggle flips the game's own passthrough mode (`_G.DragPassthrough` + the `DragNoCollide` player setting patched locally) so tagged world parts stop colliding with the held object
- **Enhanced Grabbers (optional, client-side)** — the wormhole grabbers (Grabby Grabber, Grabbiest Grabber, Lunar Staff — all one shared client behavior, found via `getgc`), tuned client-side only: **Grab Reach** (×1–100 on the server-pushed `MaxDistance` the carry ray is capped by), **Pull Power** (×1–100000 on the carry ball's `AlignPosition.MaxForce` / `AlignOrientation.MaxTorque` while a wormhole grab is live), **Grab Through Walls** (rawsets the behavior's `GetRayPosition` with the wall-clamp ray dropped, so the grab point — and the `StartDrag` position the server selects objects around — can sit at full reach past buildings; off = vanilla) and **Ghost Radius** (the `DragNoCollide` scan radius — note the game only tags vehicle-bed parts, never buildings; pair with No-Collide Drag), **Grab Teleport** (while carrying with any grabber, press **Y** — the whole pile teleports to your camera; the landing is pinned at 60 Hz and the move auto-retries for a few seconds with the game's re-aim frozen for the window — so streaming gaps at long range can't break it and you never need to spam Y; while the freecam is on, a carry lock keeps the ball frozen the whole flight — fly anywhere, press Y to bring the load; release to drop). Local writes only, no packets; server grab validation unknown — creep up and watch for rubber-banding
- **Freecam (built-in)** — **RightCtrl** toggles it (**rebindable** — Movement → Camera has a keybind row and the toggle shows the live key chip); WASD flies, mouse looks, Space/LeftCtrl up-down, Shift is a 3x boost (speed slider in Movement → Camera); movement keys are swallowed while it's on so the character stays put, vehicle fly freezes into a hover instead of fighting the camera, dying/respawning drops the freecam, every exit path (toggle off, death, cam teleport) hands the mouse back unlocked, and the camera goes back the moment you toggle off
- **Vehicle Speed (optional, client-side)** — the *driver's* client simulates cars (the game's own wheel code reads `Seat.MaxSpeed * throttle` live off the VehicleSeat), so this multiplies the seat's `MaxSpeed` + `Torque` locally: cars, barrows and planes go faster. 1–25x slider, off by default; character movement untouched — server vehicle checks unknown, throwaway mindset. **Vehicle Fly** (same tab): hovercar mode — W/S fly along the camera, A/D strafe, Space/Shift up, Ctrl down, neutral hovers, roll/pitch locked so it can't capsize; direct client velocity/angular writes on your own vehicle (cars respond cleanest); **Cam Teleport** (same tab): fly the freecam out and press **T** (rebindable — the keybind row sits under the toggle) — **on foot it teleports the player straight to the camera**, wherever the freecam is — indoors included (same warp family as the store teleports — the character is moved instantly, never made non-colliding), and seated in a vehicle it pulls the whole vehicle (wheels included — the collection walks the joint graph, sweeps the rig model plus attachment reverse-lookups, and picks wheels up by name (FL/FR/BL/BR corners + wheel/tire names); during the jump they go nocollide + weightless and get glued to the car (held at their exact car-relative pose every frame — the wheels cannot move at all while the teleport lands; deliberate glue, not a weld, so the car's physics assemblies never merge), and physics comes back when it settles; the settle re-assert fights back only the car + wheels (max 10/s), so a rig full of loose pieces can't lagspike the jump, and the wheel sweep is scoped to the vehicle's own rig model (never the whole map), so dragged scenery can't be scanned or counted as wheels) and you teleport to the camera (landing probed — nudges straight up over obstacles; camera must be >20 studs out so the chase cam never triggers it; the car is then pinned at the spot for a moment to beat physics/server drag, and the freecam drops so you see where you landed; same client-side teleport the store warps use)
- **~~Movement (experimental)~~ (removed in oak-v2)** — infinite jump, walk speed, jump power and sprint boost were live-tested: they work, but the server bans for them eventually. Nothing writes speed/jump state anymore
- **Fullbright, teleports** (full static location list from `MapInfo.Locations` — streaming-proof, includes stores that aren't streamed in yet) and **anti-AFK**
- **Menu wiring** — the Oaklands build now wires `uilib.attachInput()` (it was the one script missing it): sliders drag properly, the window drags and resizes, click-away closes popups, and the **Freecam / Cam Teleport keys are rebindable rows** with live chips on their toggles; the menu itself shows/hides on **RightShift** (a locked keybind row sits in Misc → Menu — the close button had always promised this key, but nothing was listening for it until oak-v29.11)
- **Anti-cheat shield (oak-v29.28)** — the game's obfuscated networking gate was fully decoded from the dump: every `TellServer` / `AskServer` / `CreateKeyHash` / `RequestModule` call scans the calling stack's environments (`getfenv(0..3)`) for the executor globals `getgenv` / `readfile` / `loadfile`; a hit fires `HAX:FireServer(11291)` plus a `{val = 11291}` beacon at a random hashed remote, prints "Hello Exploiter!" and hangs the calling thread. The hub never calls those methods; a new Misc → Anti-Cheat toggle (**HAX Shield**, on by default) drops the HAX report codes and the 11291 beacon locally so nothing reaches the server, and an internal `SAFE.fire` / `SAFE.ask` channel fires the game's hashed remotes directly for direct packet sends — the scanner never runs for those at all
- **Auto hit-marker (oak-v29.46)** — the V124 update added a charge minigame to chopping/mining: markers sweep the charge bar and clicking inside a marker's window is the *only* thing the server hears (`HitMarkerAttempt` packets — it times them against its own marker schedule and pays out charge speed, combo and extra hit damage). With **Auto hit-marker** on (World → Chopping), the script watches the live charge tween + marker layout and fires the attempt through the SAFE channel using the game's **exact envelope convention** (`Name = hash(actionName)` — dump-verified; the first build hashed it the wrong way, so the server saw unrecognised messages — that, not the timing, is what flagged the account) with **humanized timing**: aims near each marker's centre with jitter, deliberately botches ~13% of them, fires only while the tool says it is actively swinging and you're holding the mouse button, and starts fresh every swing — ~87% accuracy, no robot pattern
- **Character Fly / Speed hack (oak-v29.44)** — fly drives the character with our own `LinearVelocity` (100k force) on the HRP (the same engine mechanism the game's own Idle state uses to ride platforms). **Fly** (**F** toggles): full 3D — WASD along the camera, Space / Ctrl up-down, hover when idle. **Speed hack** (Movement → Character): sets the character's velocity straight toward where it is going — the game's own `MoveDirection` at the slider speed, Y untouched, and nothing is written while no keys are held (idling can never lock). If the game turns out to revert those writes, a position assist engages automatically: the character is pivoted forward the extra (speed − 16) × dt each frame along its movement direction, wall-gated by a forward ray. Both sliders go up to **500 studs/s** and holding **LeftShift sprints ×1.5** on fly and speed. No WalkSpeed / jump-state writes, no noclip, never inside geometry. Server-side checks unknown — test tier, creep the sliders
- **~~Test tab~~ (removed in oak-v29.33)** — a dump-sweep exploit set (loot vacuum, quests, kick/ban, damage aura, swing/grab redirects, local tuning) was live-tested and pulled: nothing in it gave a real advantage server-side. The **Lumberjack Sim teleport entry** (World → Teleports) and the shield/SAFE channel stay. Former contents: **Loot Vacuum** (`StoreItem` auto-pickup), **Quests** (auto fulfil / claim), **Kick / Softban** (private-server powers), **Damage Aura** (`DamageEnemy`); the passive rewrites **Swing Redirect** (your swings retarget the nearest tree / rock within the radius — the game's own packet is rewritten on the wire in the guard hook) and **Grab Point** (grab clicks send a camera-forward point at the slider range instead of the capped ray); the local tier **Weapon Stats** (damage × / radius × / attack speed ÷), **Projectile range override** (past the 100-stud clamp, up to 5000), **Chainsaw infinite fuel**, **Swing speed**, **Golf power**, **Firefly Jar** reach + auto-collect, **Fruit Basket** reach / full-gate / auto-collect — plus **Infinite Breath**, a **Run diagnostics** button (prints what's armed / found live: SAFE key, guard, redirect hashes, weapon / saw / swing / golf / jar / basket / breath / quest counts) and **Restore all test tuning**. The **Item Spawner was pulled after live testing — the server answers `SpawnItem` with an instant kick (fully server-gated)**
- No game-framework calls at all anymore (the anticheat self-reports `"[C]"` callers and module-loader misuse — nothing here does either), and the script is re-run safe like the rest of the hub

### AIMBOT — `games/80139795758532.luau` (PlaceId 80139795758532, GameId 9210599831)

A cheats-arena FPS where the game itself sells "cheats" as gameplay — built off the structure dump, this one is the real thing:

- **Aimbot** — FOV circle (radius in px, drawn exactly as the pick area), Hold RMB / Always, head or torso, team + visibility checks, max distance, smoothing (0 = straight lock; the mouse moves through the game's own input path)
- **Silent Aim** — every shot redirects to the target at the wire **using the game's own native flow**: the live `BlasterController`'s `shoot()` takes an optional CFrame, and the game's own spinbot fires exactly that way (`shoot(CFrame.lookAt(cameraPos, targetPos))` + ammo refill). The rays, hit story, headshot map and spread seed are all built by the game's own code — and the shoot packet carries no aim flag, so the server cannot tell a redirected shot apart from the game's legit cheats. Optional auto fire while a target is in FOV
- **Max aim assist** — cranks the game's own `AimAssistController` through its public setters: 2000-stud range, 180° FOV, head lock, ignore line of sight, all method strengths maxed (re-asserted every second, restored on toggle off)
- **Player ESP** — name + distance labels with enemy / teammate / bot colors and Highlight chams; **Bot ESP** covers the round bots (`Workspace.Game.__ServerBotCharacters`)
- **Weapon** — no recoil (the camera-kick function is bypassed) and infinite ammo
- Menu key RightShift, config in `havoc_hub/aimbot_config.json`, unload button in Extras

### Universal — `games/universal.luau` (any other game)

Generic toolkit for games without a dedicated script:

- **Camera aimbot** — FOV circle, smoothing, team check, optional visibility check, Hold-RMB or Always activation
- **Player ESP (fully customizable)** — corner box, name, health, distance and head/body highlight chams, with the two-window customizer (character preview + settings)
- **ESP Customizer** — two-window editor: a preview window with a real player model showing exactly how your ESP will look, plus a settings window for every element's style, placement, offsets and colours
- **Movement** — walk speed, jump power, infinite jump, fly
- **Misc** — fullbright, anti-AFK, rejoin server

## Manual setup (without the loader)

Copy `games/7336302630.luau` (or `games/universal.luau`) into your executor's workspace folder and execute it. The shared modules (`uilib.luau` and `esp.luau`) are only needed if nothing fetched them for you — without them the affected menu / ESP features are skipped with a warning.

## Configuration

- All persistent files live in one `havoc_hub/` folder (created automatically) instead of loose files cluttering the executor workspace root:
  - `havoc_hub/project_delta_config.json` — Project Delta
  - `havoc_hub/driving_empire_config.json` — Driving Empire (plus its race/ATM/requeue support files)
  - `havoc_hub/universal_hub_config.json` — the universal script
  - `havoc_hub/criminality_hub_config.json` — Criminality
  - `havoc_hub/deadline_config.json` — Deadline
- An existing loose config is moved into the folder automatically on the first run and the old file is cleaned up
- Persists keybinds (including enabled/disabled state), feature toggles and values
- To reset a script: delete its config file from `havoc_hub/` and re-execute
